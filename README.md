# Introduction

This project analyses video game data from the popular digital distribution platform, Steam, examining key features such as the number of games, prices, platforms, genres, and total playtime. The goal is to uncover data-driven insights from the gaming world. I have always enjoyed playing video games. What makes video games so captivating? Is it the thrill of excitement, the joy of entertainment, or the challenge of competition and problem-solving? Which genres and platforms dominate the market, and where do players spend the most time?


## Section 1: Growth of the Gaming Industry

The gaming industry has been a multibillion dollar industry since many decades.
Since its launch in 2003, Steam has witnessed a steady increase in the number of games released. While there was a slight slowdown in 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic, releases have rebounded and continued to rise.

Estimated revenue, based on the number of game owners and current prices, also shows consistent growth since 2009. It is important to note that revenue estimates are not a perfect metric and can vary due to changing prices over time and are excluding other revenue methods such as in app purchases.

Additionally, the release of games tends to peak during the holiday and winter seasons, aligning with increased demand during these periods.

## Section 2: Platforms, Ratings, and Revenue

The majority of games support Windows, making it the most dominant platform. Games that support both Windows and other operating systems, like Mac and Linux, have a strong presence as well. However, games released exclusively for Mac or Linux remain limited.

User ratings and recommendations also heavily favour Windows-supported games.

Top-rated games by critics are often action-oriented, with around 40% being in that genre and 40% with age restrictions of (17+). A personal favourite of mine, Portal 2, is also included here.

Interestingly, user-rated games tend to differ from critic reviews, as niche games with smaller but dedicated player bases might receive high scores. A lot of them are also (18+) suggesting older people give ratings more frequently.

Revenue insights reveal that top publishers—such as Valve, Electronic Arts, Activision, and Ubisoft—dominate the industry, with Valve gaining significant playtime from time-intensive titles like Counter-Strike. However keep in mind that playtime is a metric based on total hours played divided by the number of players, which can influence its distribution if there is not a big number of players.

Role-Playing Games (RPGs) emerge as the most profitable genre, while Indie, Action, and Animation & Modelling genres lead among high-priced games.

## Section 3: Popular Genres and Playtime Trends

When it comes to playtime distribution, the Indie genre (so called independent genre developed by smaller studios) takes the lead, followed by Action, Adventure, Simulation, RPG's, and Strategy. Smaller genres are grouped under "Others".

Further analysis shows that: Single-player games are the most popular with most number of games being in this category and Family Sharing as a close second. Many games belong to multiple categories, highlighting their versatility.

Age-restricted games take a significant share of playtime, yet non-restricted games still account for the majority.

Notably, while the Casual genre sees a large number of releases, it falls behind in terms of playtime, suggesting that many casual games are produced for profit reasons but fail to gain widespread popularity. Meanwhile, free-to-play games receive some of the highest positive reviews (around 70%), indicating strong player satisfaction.
