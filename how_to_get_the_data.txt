Use the notebook data_prep in the notebooks folder to transform the dataset from the link into games_prepped.csv ,
then launch main_app.py with the command "streamlit run main_app.py" in a new terminal with that data inside the data folder. 
For better visual select wide mode in the top right corner in settings. PS: the data is already inside the folder, should run with the command only, 
no need to use the notebook.
